See database for more details about the tables in the database. modules The program is consist of following modules/scripts. anon_pipeline.py The AnonPipeline class in the module run the complete anonymisation process. Member function anonymise can be used for anonymisation. anon_recorder.py The module records status of files and sub-directory in anonymisation process. The information is stored into a splite database whose default path is log/prog_recorder.db . anon_phi_examiner.py The module anon_summary.py The module performs anonymisation summary as in anonymisation summary . id_generator.py The module generate pseudo id for accession number and patient numbers. ocdr.py The module is for text dectection and optical character recognition.

It recommanded to use a virtual enviroment, for example: python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt a copy of file config.py should have been createed. Update the SALT variable in the file to desired value. (see features for detail about salt). If the file is not created automatically, it can be copied manually from templates/config_template.py to the root folder ( anon-pipeline-set ). Run Quick Run with example data Try the following code for a quick run with our example data: ./anon_pipeline.py example_input/ -p my_results Here, my_results will be created containing the anonymised files. Run with your own data To anonymise you own data, you can crate a folder with the following structure <input_folder>/ <accession number 1>/ <DICOM file 1> <DICOM file 2> <accession number 2>/ <DICOM file 1> <DICOM file 2> and run the following code ./anon_pipeline.py <path/to/input_folder> -p <path/to/output_folder> Please note that the input and output folder don't have to be saved in the root folder. Continuous mode and restart mode In restart mode, the program assume there are no processed files and would raise an error if it found any. This mode is the default. In continuous mode, if there are processed files in output directory, the program will skip them and continue to prcess the rest. To use continuse mode, add option -c in command, for example: ./anon_pipeline.py <path/to/input_folder> -p <path/to/output_folder> -c Please note : the program assume that assession number is used to name the sub-directory (the folder containing the DICOM files), if this is not the case the program will fail to detect processed sub-directories and process them. Exit in error The program is default to continue processing, if a unknown error is encountered when processing a sub-directory. If this option is on, the program will stop processing. Use -e option to enable this option, for example: ./anon_pipeline.py <path/to/input_folder> -p <path/to/output_folder> -e Skip extra checks If this option is on, the program will skip the optical character recoginition (OCR) search for public health information (PHI) embeded on image.
